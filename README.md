## ⚠️ Issues
The Java program contains code and comments that are not fully optimized. The code may include redundant sections, unoptimized logic, and inefficient algorithms. The comments are also inconsistent, with some sections having no comments, others containing poorly written explanations, and some comments not accurately reflecting the code's function. 
> Despite these issues, the program is designed to be functional, and it's expected to run without critical errors. This is a temporary state, and future updates will include a thorough code cleanup and optimization process. 🧹
